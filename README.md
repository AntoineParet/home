In order to install all my settings, I have made a function **downloadcmd** that ask you for each fuction listed on **cmdutiles** if you want to download it.

Before using this function, paste it on /usr/bin

    sudo cp download /usr/bin
    downloadcmd

After typing this command, just answer by `y` if you need this function or `n` if you don't need it yet.

Another function have been made to properly add paquets to the **cmdutiles** list : **addcmd**
Just type `addcmd yourfunction`
